This serves as an example project to train data science skills. It takes a look at the kaggle New York Air BnB data set.

## 1. Installations
You need to have the following dependencies installed with pip3:
- jupyter notebook
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- folium
- seaborn


## 2. Project Motivation
Ever tried to find a good place to stay in New York City? This project should analyze the NYC AirBnB data set and try to find out which prices to expect in a certain location. We are going to analyze the quality of the data set to train what has been learned in the Udacity data science course.

## 3. File Descriptions
- dataScience.ipynb - the source code
- AB_NYC_2019.csv - the data set


## 4. How to Interact with your project
Open the project in a jupyter notebook and just run it. If you have installed all python dependencies everything should work.

## 5. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.
MIT Licensing - special thanks to Udacity and Kaggle for providing the data set.
